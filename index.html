<a name="The Syntaf Particle Simulator" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Syntaf Particle Simulator</h3>

<p>This Simulator is currently an ongoing project, originally used to test my knowledge and understanding of OpenGL and SFML, the project grew on me and I continued development. I plan to eventually include a build system or 
maybe even an executable under release, but for now it will remain a VS2012 project. To understand what the simulator currently does, here is a recent build, <strong>password:</strong> particles</p>

<p>Cool right? Well there's plenty more features to come!</p>

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Exactly Is This Doing?</h3>

<p>The simulator currently combines mouse input with newtons famous law (1/2)at^2 + v(i)t. Particles continually accelerate towards the mouse point 
 while the user holds down LMB. Once released, a constant drag force is applied until the particles eventually grind to a halt, making for some pretty
 neat formations in the simulations!

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Real World Applications</h3>

<p>In it's current state, the simulator has very few, if any, real world applications. The project was originally a test of my openGL skills in the programmable pipeline, and grew into a hobby
   . Features are always being added and who knows, maybe in the short future the Particle simulator will have some real uses! Till then make sure to drop by and contribute, or at least say wave as you pass by.</p>
