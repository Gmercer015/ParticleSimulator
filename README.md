=================

A particle simulator written with C++ SFML OpenGL and HPX demonstrating the power of parallelism.

**Required Libraries**
--------------------------------------------------------

| Library        | Minimum Version           | Header Only  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| GLM           | 0.9.5.3       | Yes   |
| GLEW          | 1.5.3         |   No |
| SFML          | 2.1           |   No |

[**GLM**](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.5/index.html):  A header only C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specification and released under the MIT license.

[**GLEW**](http://glew.sourceforge.net/):   A cross-platform open-source C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform. OpenGL core and extension functionality is exposed in a single header file. GLEW has been tested on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Irix, and Solaris.
  
[**SFML**](http://www.sfml-dev.org/):   SFML provides a simple interface to the various components of your PC, to ease the development of games and multimedia applications.
