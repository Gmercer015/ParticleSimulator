ParticleSimulator
=================

~~A particle simulator written with C++ SFML OpenGL and HPX demonstrating the power of parallelism.~~

**NOTE** 
This branch takes advantage of OpenGL's fixed function pipeline. A version is currently under development that uses the programmable pipeline, offering more control and efficiency. As a result this branch is no longer under development, switch to branch **ProgPipe** to view recent advances.
